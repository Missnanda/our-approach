    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p><strong>Personalized. Intentional. Designed for Growth.</strong></p>
    <p>At B. Miss Nanda, we do not follow a one-size-fits-all path. We carefully shape each learning journey to reflect the unique rhythm, pace, and mindset of every child — and every family.</p>

    <h2>Thoughtful Intake</h2>
    <p>Before a student is accepted, we begin with a private invitation request, followed by a Learning Environment & Activities Questionnaire. This process helps us understand more than just academic level — we look at habits, attention span, daily structure, and parental involvement.</p>

    <h2>Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistency over intensity</li>
      <li>Process-driven results</li>
      <li>Shared responsibility between tutor, student, and family</li>
      <li>A healthy, calm learning environment</li>
      <li>Long-term transformation, not shortcuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disciplines We Focus On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>English (grammar, comprehension, communication)</li>
      <li>Mathematics (logic, problem-solving, foundations)</li>
      <li>Physics (concept-based understanding)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Support includes private tutoring, homework guidance, and exam preparation — always within the boundaries of our rhythm-based method.</p>

    <h2>The Rhythm of Learning</h2>
    <p>We believe progress is most sustainable when students have a reliable schedule and emotional clarity. Sessions are planned in advance, routines are respected, and reschedules are limited to maintain stability.
    We accept only a few families at a time. Each session is prepared intentionally — with purpose, not pressure.</p>

    <h2>Parent Partnership</h2>
    <p>As part of our approach, we regularly share personalized notes, progress insights, and strategy reflections with parents. You are not just informed — you are involved.</p>

    <h2>Privacy & Boundaries</h2>
    <p>We are deeply committed to the safety and focus of our students. All communication and learning spaces are managed mindfully. We do not take photos of students. Names and schools are only shared with written consent for testimonials.</p>

    <h2>Commitment Before Continuity</h2>
    <p>Students are accepted by invitation only. A trial session may be offered before a full-term agreement is made. Every relationship begins with alignment — not urgency.</p>

    <h2>Honoring the Journey to Mastery</h2>
    <p>We believe excellence deserves acknowledgment. When a student earns a perfect score — through consistent effort, focus, and growth — we mark that moment quietly with a curated token of recognition. Not as a prize, but as a pause to honor their journey.</p>
